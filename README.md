Let me introduce myself !



#### Who am I ?

##### Born Valentin in Brest, France at January 21st 2005. As far as I can remember, I was always behind line codes. All I can remember is me coding a little tool for Minecraft servers.

#### First big project

##### At summer 2019, me and two of my friends made a "Five Nights at Freddy's" fan-game. It was called "Entertainment". 

#### What do I do now ?

##### I only work on games on free-time now. But I fell in love with automation, I discovered I like to automate tasks so I'm learning Bash, Python, C and C#.

#### Some of my projects !
